- 👋 Hi, I’m @coderrata, as laboring worker all of my life basically I was destined to make the change that I was eventually forced into. An injury at my previous employment left me with excruciatiing nerve pain at times. This also happened to be quite random. A wrong move, playing with my children or opening up the door - even walking could lead to pain. I was then left with no choice but to leave the physical labor market entirely. Not a bad thing though, as time goes on I realized that my major benefit is in efficiency. Business and productivity efficiency. Creating better and easier ways to do things. Previous attempts to learn the craft of programming have failed for numerous reasons. The ability to designate time when working long hours, while maintaining a family all contributed to a difficult environment conducive to me focuing for long periods of time which is necessary. The last years of injury stunted my learning heavily to the point where for months I was incapable of completing even the most minor of basic tasks. The instance became better and I was able to proceed and move further as the injury slowly bettered itself. At this point I felt as if the necessary instances were coming together on this one greatly and that the most painful occurrance in my life was just a forceful push in the direction I already knew I needed to go. The physical pace that I was moving at between work and home was extreme. The type of intent that I put into my work was intense, physically, allowing little else for the family that I cared for. This change is great and the feeling I get from it is excitement. Not nervousness, or even fear, just a content feeling of "This is where I need to be".
